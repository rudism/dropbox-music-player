# Dropbox Music Player

Super simple, responsive, static HTML5 music player that can stream music from Dropbox folders. Displays album art in the background (when available). There is no server component, it runs client-side in the browser using HTML and Javascript.

Online demo: https://music.sitosis.com

## Status

Can be used to list and play albums on Dropbox as long as they're stored correctly. Functional on desktop and mobile.

## Expected Music Storage Format

After logging in, you specify a root directory in which to scan for music (for example, `/Music`). The application expects you to store `mp3` or `ogg` files in "album" folders within the root directory that you specified. By default, directories in your root music path are not themselves scanned for subfolders, though this can be tweaked in the settings.

For example, consider the following file structure:

```
Music/
|
+-- Bal Sagoth - Starfire Burning Upon the Ice-Veiled Throne of Ultima Thule/
|   |
|   +-- 01 Black Dragons Soar Above the Mountain of Shadows (Prologue).ogg
|   +-- 02 To Dethrone the Witch-Queen of Mythos K'unn (The Legend of the Battle of Blackhelm Vale).ogg
|   +-- 03 As the Vortex Illumines the Crystalline Walls of Kor-Avul-Thaa.ogg
|   +-- Folder.jpg
|
+-- John R. Butler - Surprise/
|   |
|   +-- 01 Yodel in Reverse.mp3
|   +-- 02 Hyphenated Name.mp3
|   +-- 03 Holiday Play.mp3
|   +-- Cover.jpg
|   |
|   +-- Best of College A Cappella 1995/
|       |
|       +-- 01 Everything She Wants.mp3
|       +-- 02 Soul to Squeeze.mp3
|       +-- 03 This Woman's Work.mp3
|       +-- Cover.png
|       
+-- _Soundtracks/
    |
    +-- John Williams - Jurassic Park/
        |
        +-- 01 Opening Titles.ogg
        +-- 02 Theme from Jurassic Park.ogg
        +-- 03 Incident at Isla Nublar.ogg
```

In the above example, the Bal Sagoth and John R. Butler albums are in the root `/Music` directory and therefore will be found and listed. The Best of College A Cappella album is located within a subdirectory, and therefore will be missed. You should move it out into the root `/Music` directory for it to start working. The Jurassic Park soundtrack is also inside a folder; instead of moving it to the root, you could set your "Album Containers" setting to `_Soundtracks`, which would then cause the player to look for albums inside that directory instead of treating it as an album itself.

## Installing and Running

```
$ git clone https://github.com/rudism/dropbox-music-player.git
$ cd dropbox-music-player
$ cp config.json.example static/config.json
```

At this point, you should edit `static/config.json` and put in your Dropbox app key. You can create a new app with an app key by visiting https://www.dropbox.com/developers.

Then you can build using `gulp`:

```
$ npm install
$ gulp
```

To run, configure your webserver to serve the files in `dropbox-music-player/public`. You will need to configure the site to use SSL since Dropbox will only authenticate users at `https://` urls except for when running on `localhost`.

You can also run it locally using the gulp `connect` task, then point your browser to `http://localhost:9002`:

```
$ gulp connect
```
